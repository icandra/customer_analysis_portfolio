## Project 2 | [Customer Segmentation in EVERYTHING PLUS](https://github.com/icandra/customer_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20for%20EVERYTHING%20PLUS)
This project aims to improve customer segmentation for Everything Plus: Plus a Little Bit More, an e-commerce company specializing in household goods. My team and I developed a new customer segmentation approach (i.e. RFM analysis, unsupervised learning, combination of RFM and unsupervised learning) by analyzing transaction history data. The new segmentation should enable the company to create more personalized offers for different user groups, leading to a minimum 5% increase in conversion rates, revenue, and user retention.<br>
