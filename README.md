This project aims to improve customer segmentation for Everything Plus: Plus a Little Bit More, an e-commerce company specializing in household goods. My team and I developed a new customer segmentation approach (i.e., RFM analysis, unsupervised learning, and a combination of RFM and unsupervised learning) by analyzing transaction history data. The new segmentation should enable the company to create more personalized offers for different user groups, leading to a minimum 5% increase in conversion rates, revenue, and user retention.<br>

During the project, I collaborated with Model Fitness, a gym chain, to develop a customer interaction strategy using analytical data. The primary focus was on combating customer churn, a common challenge faced by gyms and similar services. To tackle this issue, Model Fitness digitized customer profiles and aimed to identify potential churn scenarios. The analysis involved predicting churn probabilities for each customer in the upcoming month, creating user portraits to understand distinct groups, and analyzing factors influencing churn. By drawing comprehensive conclusions and recommendations, the project aimed to enhance customer service through targeted group identification, churn reduction measures, and other insights concerning customer interaction.


## Project February, 2023 | [Cohort Analysis for Marketing Expenses in Yandex Afisha](https://github.com/icandra/customer_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Cohort%20Analysis%20-%20Marketing%20Expenses%20in%20Yandex%20Afisha)

During my internship in the analytical department at Yandex Afisha, I was tasked with optimizing marketing expenses for the platform, which facilitates online ticket purchases for cinemas, theaters, and concerts. The project involved analyzing server logs, order data, and marketing expenses statistics spanning June 2017 to May 2018. The main objective was to gain insights into user behavior, customer acquisition, revenue generation, and payback periods. The analysis was divided into three stages: data preprocessing, followed by cohort analysis focusing on product, sales, and marketing aspects. By understanding how customers used the platform and when they made purchases, the project successfully improved marketing strategies and cost efficiency.
