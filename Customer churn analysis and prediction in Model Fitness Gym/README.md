## Project Description
Model Fitness is a gym chain developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles.

For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Of course, they may be travelling and will resume their visits when they return, but that's different from a typical case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, and disappears, they're unlikely to return.

## Objective
In this project, I will assist Model Fitness in analyzing their customer churn based on the data they have and coming up with a customer retention strategy.

Here's the following analysis that will be conducted:
1. Learning to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
2. Drawing up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
3. Analyzing the factors that impact churn most
4. Drawing basic conclusions and developing recommendations on how to improve customer service by:<br>
    a) Identifying target groups <br>
    b) Suggesting measures to cut churn <br>
    c) Describing any other detected patterns concerning the interaction with customers <br>
