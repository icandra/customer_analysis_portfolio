I've been offered an internship in the analytical department at Yandex Afisha. Yandex Afisha ("playbill") is part of the business unit of Yandex Company (ru) in the field of Entertainment Services. It allows users to buy online tickets to cinemas, theaters, and concerts. 

The Marketing Department gave me the task of optimizing marketing expenses. Here I had access for:
- server logs with data on Y.Afisha visits from June 2017 through May 2018
- Dump file with all orders for the period
- Marketing expenses statistics

## Objective
The analysis objective is:
- Get to know how people use the product
- When they start to buy
- How much money each customer brings
- When they pay off

## STAGES
This analysis will be divided into three main stages.
 1. STAGE 1 - Get Started
 2. STAGE 2 - Data Preprocessing
 3. STAGE 3 - Cohort Analysis<br>
    3.1. Product Analysis (user behaviors, retention rate, churn rate)<br>
    3.2. Sales Analysis (conversion rate, purchase size, LTV)<br>
    3.3. Marketing Analysis (Marketing costs, CAC, ROMI)
